Paper: https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02871840/

# Abstract:
 We propose a functional view of matrix decomposition problems on graphs such as geometric matrix completion and graph regularized dimensionality reduction. Our unifying framework is based on a key idea that using reduced basis to represent a function on the product space of graph is sufficient to recover a low rank matrix approximation even from a sparse signal. We validate our framework on several real and synthetic benchmarks (for both problems) where it either outperforms state of the art or achieves competitive results at a fraction of the computational effort of prior work.
